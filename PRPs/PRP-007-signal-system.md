# PRP-007: Signal System Implementation

**Status**: 🟢 DoR Met
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Owner**: System (User Request via Claude Sonnet 4.5)
**Priority**: HIGH
**Complexity**: 8/10

## 📋 Description

Implement a comprehensive **Signal System** for PRP workflow that tracks emotional and progress states throughout development tasks. This system enables AI agents to communicate their current state, progress, and blockers through standardized emotional signals that guide workflow decisions.

The signal system transforms the PRP workflow from simple task tracking into an emotionally-aware, context-driven development process where agents can:
- Express their current state (tired, confident, blocked, excited)
- React to previous signals left by other agents or themselves
- Prioritize work based on signal strength (1-10 scale)
- Coordinate across multiple PRPs when tasks spawn new requirements

## 🎯 Goal

Create a **living progress tracking system** where every agent interaction is logged with:
1. **Role** (Developer, System Analyst, Tester, Designer, etc.)
2. **DateTime** (ISO 8601 timestamp)
3. **Comment** (detailed progress description with personality)
4. **Signal** (emotional/state indicator with strength value)

This enables:
- **Context preservation** across agent sessions
- **Intelligent prioritization** based on signal strength
- **Personality-driven collaboration** (System Analyst uses Portuguese, etc.)
- **LOOP MODE** execution guided by signals

## 🏁 Final State

### What Success Looks Like

1. **AGENTS.md Updated** with complete signal system documentation:
   - 14+ signals defined (ATTENTION, BLOCKED, URGENT, TIRED, CONFUSED, EXCITED, ENCANTADO, CONFIDENT, VALIDATED, FRUSTRATED, OPTIMISTIC, CAUTIOUS, RESEARCHING, COMPLETED)
   - Each signal has: emoji, strength (1-10), meaning, action required
   - Signal reaction patterns documented with examples
   - Agent personality system defined (System Analyst with Portuguese flair)

2. **PRP Template Updated** with Progress Log format:
   ```markdown
   ## 📊 Progress Log

   | Role | DateTime | Comment | Signal |
   |------|----------|---------|--------|
   | User (via Claude Sonnet 4.5) | 2025-10-28T10:00:00Z | Created new PRP for signal system. This is complex but incredibly valuable - it will transform how agents collaborate and maintain context. Requires comprehensive documentation and examples. | ATTENTION 🔴 (10) |
   ```

3. **Mandatory PRP Workflow** enforced in AGENTS.md:
   - Always find/create PRP before work
   - TUI selection if multiple PRPs exist
   - New PRP creation flow with all required fields
   - CLI flags: `--file`, `--new`

4. **PRP LOOP MODE** fully documented:
   - Retrieve PRP → Read → Check git status
   - If uncommitted changes → comment with signal → commit
   - Execute work → Update progress log → Leave signal
   - Loop until DoD met or checkpoint reached
   - Integration with compact/clear hooks

5. **README.md Updated** with main project goal:
   - Prominent description of PRP methodology
   - Signal system overview
   - LOOP MODE explanation
   - Reference to AGENTS.md for detailed workflow

## 📊 Progress Log

| Role | DateTime | Comment | Signal |
|------|----------|---------|--------|
| User (via Claude Sonnet 4.5) | 2025-10-28T12:30:00Z | Created PRP-007 for signal system implementation. This specification came from user's comprehensive request to formalize the emotional signal system in PRPs. The complexity is high (8/10) because it requires updates to AGENTS.md, README.md, and establishing patterns for all future PRPs. However, the value is exceptional - this transforms PRP from simple task tracking into an emotionally-aware, context-driven development workflow. The System Analyst personality with Portuguese flair is particularly delightful (encantado!). AGENTS.md is already 60% complete with comprehensive signal definitions and reaction patterns. README.md just updated with main project goal. This PRP itself serves as an example of the signal system in action. | ATTENTION 🔴 (10) |
| Developer (Claude Sonnet 4.5) | 2025-10-28T12:35:00Z | Completed AGENTS.md updates with all 14 signals, reaction patterns, and LOOP MODE flow. Updated README.md to highlight PRP methodology as the main project goal. Created this PRP-007 specification document. All documentation foundation work is complete. The signal system is now fully specified and ready for practical testing. Next step: commit everything and update CHANGELOG.md. | CONFIDENT ✅ (3) |

## 📝 Technical Notes

### Signal Strength Priority

When multiple signals exist in a PRP:
1. **9-10 (Critical)**: Address immediately (ATTENTION, BLOCKED, URGENT)
2. **6-8 (High)**: Address soon (TIRED, ENCANTADO, FRUSTRATED)
3. **3-5 (Medium)**: Normal workflow (CONFIDENT, OPTIMISTIC, CAUTIOUS)
4. **1-2 (Low)**: Informational (RESEARCHING, VALIDATED)

### Agent Personalities

- **System Analyst**: Uses Portuguese words occasionally (encantado, incrível, perfeito)
- **Developer**: Pragmatic, direct, focuses on implementation
- **Tester**: Skeptical, thorough, questions assumptions
- **Designer**: Visual, aesthetic, user-focused

### Example Signal Reactions

#### TIRED (Strength 6)
**Agent finds**: Developer left TIRED signal at 60% completion
**Action**:
1. Review what's been completed
2. Create task inventory/checklist
3. Commit work-in-progress
4. Either take break or switch to easier task
5. Update PRP with checkpoint status

#### ENCANTADO (Strength 8)
**Agent finds**: System Analyst left ENCANTADO signal with 3 new PRPs
**Action**:
1. Read all spawned PRPs (PRP-002, PRP-003, PRP-004)
2. Check each PRP's signals
3. Identify strongest signal across all PRPs
4. Execute that PRP's task
5. Return to original PRP after completion

#### BLOCKED (Strength 9)
**Agent finds**: Developer left BLOCKED signal - missing API credentials
**Action**:
1. Identify specific blocker (API credentials)
2. Check if blocker can be resolved (check docs, ask user)
3. If not resolvable: escalate in PRP comment
4. Switch to different PRP or task
5. Set reminder to check blocker status

## 🚧 Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Signal system too complex for agents to follow | High | Start with 5 core signals, expand gradually |
| Agents ignore signals and work without PRP | High | Make workflow MANDATORY in AGENTS.md Policy #0 |
| Progress logs become too verbose | Medium | Encourage concise comments, personality adds flavor but shouldn't dominate |
| Signal strength values inconsistent | Medium | Provide clear examples in AGENTS.md for each strength level |
| LOOP MODE runs indefinitely | High | Define clear checkpoint rules (context limit, time limit, DoD reached) |
