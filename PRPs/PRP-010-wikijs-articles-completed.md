# PRP-010: Wiki.js Template Articles Completed

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
**Created:** 2025-10-28
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-28
**Outcome:** All 13 stub Wiki.js template articles now contain comprehensive, fact-checked PRP methodology content

---

## Problem Statement

**Context:**
v0.3.0 released with wikijs template, but user verification revealed that 13/20 articles are STUBS (12-16 lines with "[Content continues...]" placeholders). Users expect complete PRP instructions in generated wikis.

**Pain Points:**
- Core methodology articles (10-13) lack actual PRP workflow content
- CLI usage guides (20-22) don't explain how to use @dcversus/prp
- Contributing guide (30) is a stub
- Wiki.js admin guides (40-42) provide no actual guidance
- Reference articles (50-51) incomplete

**Value Proposition:**
Complete articles make wikijs template immediately useful for:
1. Non-developers learning PRP methodology
2. Teams documenting PRP workflows
3. Wiki.js administrators setting up knowledge bases
4. Contributors understanding how to help

---

## Outcome / Goal

**What Success Looks Like:**

✅ **All 20 articles have comprehensive content:**
- Article 10 (PRP Overview): 200+ lines with complete workflow, LOOP MODE, flat structure
- Article 11 (Signal System): 300+ lines with all 14 signals, reaction patterns, examples
- Article 12 (Context-Driven): 150+ lines explaining context > commands philosophy
- Article 13 (Human as Agent): 150+ lines on orchestrator autonomy, human as subordinate
- Article 20 (CLI Installation): 100+ lines with npm, npx, troubleshooting
- Article 21 (CLI Usage): 200+ lines with examples for all templates
- Article 22 (Templates): 150+ lines documenting all 6 templates
- Article 30 (Contributing): 100+ lines from CONTRIBUTING.md
- Article 40 (Wiki.js Basics): 100+ lines with setup, navigation, editing
- Article 41 (Content Management): 100+ lines with page creation, organization
- Article 42 (Best Practices): 100+ lines with style guide, maintenance
- Article 50 (Research Papers): 50+ lines with academic references
- Article 51 (External Resources): 50+ lines with curated links

✅ **All articles have:**
- Proper frontmatter with tags
- Citations for all factual claims
- Fact-check sections
- Code examples (tested)
- Links to source documentation
- Self-check criteria met

✅ **Template generates complete, production-ready wikis**

### Files to Modify

**Generator File:**
- `src/generators/wikijs.ts` - Update all 13 stub generator functions

**Test File:**
- `tests/e2e/install-upgrade.test.ts` - Add wikijs template test

**Documentation:**
- `README.md` - Add wikijs template example
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Document article completion

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Option 1: Complete Articles Now
**Status:** ✅ EXECUTING (per user request)

**Approach:**
1. Create feature branch: `feature/complete-wikijs-articles`
2. For each stub article:
   - Read source documentation
   - Extract relevant content
   - Rewrite in wiki-friendly format
   - Add frontmatter, citations, fact-checks
   - Test code examples
   - Verify links
3. Update generator function in wikijs.ts
4. Test generation locally
5. Update README.md and CHANGELOG.md
6. Create PR with all changes

**Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours
**Risk:** Low - Content already exists in project docs
**Benefit:** HIGH - Template immediately production-ready

### Option 2: Document Current State
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

**Actions Taken:**
- PRP-009 updated with ATTENTION signal
- PRP-010 created with comprehensive spec
- User informed of current limitations

### Option 3: Add Warning Notes to Stubs
**Status:** 🔄 WILL EXECUTE

**Approach:**
- Add prominent note to each stub article:
  ```markdown
  > **⚠️ This article is under development.**
  >
  > For complete information, see:
  > - [AGENTS.md](https://github.com/dcversus/prp/blob/main/AGENTS.md)
  > - [README.md](https://github.com/dcversus/prp/blob/main/README.md)
  > - [PRP Repository](https://github.com/dcversus/prp)
  ```

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Content Accuracy
**Impact:** Articles contain incorrect PRP methodology
**Probability:** LOW (sourcing from actual project docs)
**Mitigation:**
- Copy content verbatim from AGENTS.md/README.md where possible
- Add fact-check sections
- Test all code examples
- Self-check against 13-point criteria from article 32

### Risk 2: Time Overrun
**Impact:** Takes longer than 4-6 hours
**Probability:** MEDIUM (comprehensive articles are time-intensive)
**Mitigation:**
- Work systematically through priority order
- Focus on core content first, polish later
- User understands this is significant work

### Risk 3: Generator File Conflicts
**Impact:** wikijs.ts becomes too large to maintain
**Probability:** LOW (already 1600+ lines)
**Mitigation:**
- Keep generator functions focused
- Extract common content to helper functions if needed
- Consider splitting into multiple generator modules in future
