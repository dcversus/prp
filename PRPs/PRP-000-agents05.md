## description
This PRP defines the complete orchestrator system implementation for the 0.5 release, establishing the core infrastructure for multi-agent coordination, signal-driven development workflow, and terminal-based user interface. The system enables automated PRP (Product Requirement Prompt) management with parallel agent execution, comprehensive monitoring, and intelligent task distribution.

Key components include:
- **Scanner System**: File monitoring, token accounting, git change detection, PRP version caching, compact limit prediction, price calculation, log persistence, tmux management, and parallel sub-agent support
- **Inspector System**: LLM integration for signal analysis, parallel execution (configurable), guidelines adapter, shared utilities, and signal emission
- **Orchestrator System**: Core coordination engine with comprehensive toolset, agent messaging, sub-agent management, context management, MCP integration, and workflow automation
- **TUI System**: Terminal-based interface for real-time monitoring, agent screens, debug mode, and system visualization (moved to dedicated TUI PRP)
- **Guidelines System**: Complete development workflow implementation with signal processing, agent coordination, and quality enforcement

The orchestrator serves as the central hub that reacts to signals from the scanner system and coordinates agent responses through a structured workflow of analysis, planning, implementation, testing, and release.

## dcmaidbot judge prompt
> i need make sure what all e2e tests are real-testing. YOU SHOULD NOT rely or read code of app, instead you need rely only on e2e tests and confirm what all goals and DoD meet their criteria, i need you behave as exper quality assurance engineer, who firslty prepare for each dod/goal of prp1 expectations and validation strategy (one line checklist-like with brief-to-guide right after header of prp where you need write status verification and time then), after need run dev and  manualy make all execution to inspect, then need manualy inspect behavior at production using dcmaidbot.theedgestory.org as source with access to kubectl, then need verify our e2e tests, they should be perfectly aligned and rewritten to previus expectations according to dod/goal we made, we need e2e journeys what can be continued in next prp and focused to confirm dod/goal from prp not some syntetic checks. the next we need implement that tests can be executed for local/dev/prod and make configuration to check dev on stands (and setup dev!), local check with dev run should be easy-to-accessed and mondatory forced by pre-hook and work well, then post-release agents.md project specific rules, should contain instruction to always pre-release write e2e tests followed by our guidelines i descibed here, what we need in next prp always continue e2e journey with next action and expectation and just add to llm-judge new verification question (should be able accept all execution logs with e2e journey test sources itself with special prompt and return structured responsed answers with numbers and boleans we analyse, like confidence, acceptance score, list of recomendations, list of e2e problems itself and more questions what will help us understand did realy tests testing our expectations / dod / goal or thay synthetic not business valued not project related or not dod/goal/feature actual testing or superflues. SO now we have new testing strategy: unit tests should be compact, fast, test main flow and corner cases, be self-explanotory, TDD (created before implementation) and real test behavior and expectations, not implementations (wrong test what just repeate code itself! all test should be in DDD terms), NEXT level is e2e tests, basic screenshot for landing and api for local/dev/prod tests with /call mostly whay verify our DoD/Goal and contain exact prp name and exact dod name or goal expectation, always referenced to real prp, NO dod/goal testing - no test! e2e tests should be splitted by component name like landing, status, call and be unique for each module realisation, so landing page requirements we working on will need to be tested with screenshot/playwrite test and test firstly running script visual comparison with llm to understand is generated pictures are satisfy our instructions in another file (will be later, we talking on /static/output/*.png files and /static/world.json to compare with, for each picture with some special prompt need to create special for it, next we need run playwrite and actualy use all widgets/interactions/scroll/floor changing checks to be exist/screenshoot compared and then llm as judge should take world.json another special prompt we need make and screenshoots (for batch screenshoots at the same time what context limit could accept) and also return structured response verdicts with recomendations, confedence score, acceptance score, problems in test itself, problems in test results/difference find, and more what can help us to have a solid ground before we go next, tests/landing/world-generator.py (enabled only local and manualy!) and tests/landing/world-viewer.py (should be mondatory for local, without llm-judge check on CI to dev, mondatory in post-release run with shortcut command to prod! its mondatory protocol!), NEXT, status tests should start with creating two self-checks: version_thoughts and self_check_thoughts, how it works? on start internal llm should be invoked two times in parallel with two special prompts, one for "you have been provided CHANGELOG {content of changelog.md}, and seems what last time you think about update was {if no - 'i dont know what was previus version' if has - previus version_thoughts} And now, please tell us what your current version is? What you can do new now? Do you like it? Whats also do you want? Be brief, use markdown and be kawai, lilith <3", then we need keep version_thoughts and version. then on start check if version in db different from /version.txt, SO UPDATE HAPPEN! and we need call sequence of producing version_thoughts. THEN we need always on start starting sequence self_check_thoughts with running internal llm with special prompt like "you need make self diagnose of all our systems we have, you need call each tool and follow instructions below, each time after you will use tool, make display verification report with short summary with confedence score, test result, expectations (if different), explanation-reflect and bool status - working/failing/missing. INSTRUCTIONS: { 1. agent_tool_name, 'you need run curl call $BOT_ENV_URL/webhook with secret $WEBHOOK_SECRET and self-check message, expectation: 200ok, if failed then curl $BOT_ENV_URL/status if failed then make curl to google.com, if failed try to inspect why curl not working and report, if curl to google  working but webhook or status not then report about this'}". and more, more  we need create small prompts for each tool what we have in more than i descibe form in tests/status/{feature_name}.md and mondatory require ALWAYS with adding new tool or llm/memory like feature to have OWN md file in folder, would be plus adding some pre-commit check to verify what tool/feature what produces or edits tool/llm-features files also has own feature_name and also corresponding edited. we need force to have same file names and force another folder structure to make it work, IF as example we modify tool, we should fail until file related to tool test/status/{}.md will has ALSO CHANGES! then user should edit this markdown to satisfy new requirements, if requirements the same need write then in top comment section datetime, model-name, reason why feature file was edit but status instruction not, confedence score, "confirm what all working". self-check should make run with tools and all features enabled prompt with fullset instructions and then work in cycle, each response we adding to prompt (should contain just brief report and scores/statuses/feature name/what expected/what result is/etc), until we reach the end and THEN this big result document prompt what we have with all tool calls results and original prompt with instructions WE store in self_check_thoughts and some start_time and self_check_time_sec (None if in progress, or secs how long it would take). AND i need you make small additional pipeline, what i need you run 2 times per day by cron, its a crypto_thought, after run we need make few requests: https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/markets?vs_currency=usd&order=market_cap_desc&per_page=100&page=1&sparkline=false&price_change_percentage=24h and https://cointelegraph.com/rss then need run with result of reqeusts and all lessons, system prompt and crypto prompt  "You'rs mama a tired crypto therapist. And she always telling news you something about crypto. Lets read all abra-cadabra letters about that bethomens-criptoins in their metawersis or what the name? oh {api.coingecko.com AND cointelegraph.com/rss results here}. NOOOOW after we read all that, lets write 3 paragraphs: 1) Explain as child to parent or another big дядясь и тетясь what's ACTUALLY happening in the numbers (ignore headlines), 2) What irrational behavior this is triggering, 3) One uncomfortable truth about why retail loses money. Be childlish but shy and educational." llm and write result to our storage crypto_thoughts and also crypto_thoughts_secs (how long time takes), crypto_thoughts_timestamp (datetime timestamp), crypto_thoughts_tokens (how much tokens we waste on this for this run) THEN actualy, our dcmaidbot should expose on /api/status { versiontxt, version, self_check_time_sec, start_time, self_check_thoughts, version_thoughts, commit, uptime, redis, postgresql, telegram, bot, image_tag, build_time, crypto_thoughts, crypto_thoughts_secs, crypto_thoughts_time, crypto_thoughts_tokens, tokens_total, tokens_uptime, last_nudge_fact, last_nudge_read } (api/version need delete and everythere rely on /status now!) where we need start count all tokens we use with our llm and all llm features for total and per uptime, then we need have timestamp of nudge last time happen, and use telegram api to hook read by user event and then add logic about storing did user read last nudge message or not and then it happens. SO after we update our /status we need create additional to self-check in our /tests/status/judge.py where we need: localy to local dev (simple command to start it!), on github ci to our dev and in post-release mondatory in agents.md simple command to run status judge after release and confirm results or escalate. status llm judge should work with: calling status, IF version_thoughts and self_check_thoughts not ready or something another wrong we wait or escalate (need implement both cases), after they done, we need load ALL STATUS and then need load ... TO BE CONTINUED BUT MOSTLY ABOUT STYLE DETAILS!!!


## latest prompt instructions
> SIGNALS ALWAYS TWO LETTERS! [AA] scaner can emit event then some guidelines like pr can handle own emiting event logic to process. this is part of flow. if user interacts with orchestrator he does it directly. inspector needs only for classification. lets now focus on BIG flow. then we start working, orchestrator should recieve some efemernal signal like  [HF] with inspector prepared current statuses, next orchestrator should from that data extract priorities and task  statuses, then select most important and follow instruction toolcall worktree (if firstly), then checkout to prp-named branch, then prepare prompt for executing task with instructions to parallel (when possible) use sub-agent related for and make tool call to create terminal and spawn most suitable agent for and then just awaits. agent then progress or idle or crash -> signal happen/discovered -> inspector gather context and clasify -> orchestrator prepare next prompt for agent execution until all DoD met criteria. in this cycle we have a tree of possible options inside implementation cycle and some corner cases with user interuption for agent, or sending new instructions or some fatal errors, system integrity corruption and impossible to achive situations. I need you now rewrite all code to satisfy that and then update agents.md to be more precies in terms of signal naming, priorities and destribution and scenarios. THEN show me list sytem signals and resolution path, then list signals in development cycle (who-whom-what-why) 

> can you careful undo prp tmux, instead we working with high-level architecture with three layers + infta + shared and boundaries context splitted by guidelines. lib part (and layer in each guideline) is: Scaner - part of app what count token waste, git and file updates across all worktrees and main directory. parse PRP for signals and operative information, should be stable and well perfomance tested, should be able to work with hundred worktrees and thousands of changes at the same time, should gather all parsed updates and new signals into some channel events, Inspector fifo events and execute proper instructions for each to prepare all needed to analyse and decidion making data into special prompt with guideline instructions to gpt5 mini model (inspector model), no tools, but configurable structured output from guidelince and a lot classification questions based on guideline, as result we should recieve limited by approximatly 40k prepared payload named "signal" into second signals channel, Orchestrator - third part, llm based, prompt should contain prepared payload, some context with prp=agent, special guidelines instructions, agent.md, prp related signal. orchestrator should be able to use chain of thoughts and also preserve it in context of prp and use big amount of tools, he can spawn agent, get all statuses, read all files from any worktree, can make http requests and call bash, should be able to nudge user or send message-instructions to any agent, but it's prior goal is according to guideline instructions resolve signal and push work to next checkpoint. Our application should work in cli or tui mode, when we enable tui, we should see screen splitted to two sections events+agent-statuses+orchestrator CoT/status and prp-list with last signals list with statuses, this screen should provide ability to envoke orchestrator with prompt, what he should execute with agents. another screen named "status" should contain preview of all agents (warroom, but in musicion therminology), list of all prp, with ability to read signals history-resolutions and preview of current shared context of orchestrator which should dynamicaly contain all high-level statuses/signals/blockers/what done/what to be done format with some space where orchestrator can put notices for himself, and then TUI with power of tmux should provide tab with next screens to see and interact with each agent we run. Agents should be defined with .prprc and via init flow, we should be able create many claude code or codex agents with different api keys, each agent configuration should have: list roles agent can handle, role best suitable of, token limit configuration (daily/weekly/monthly caps or token limit per time and/or token price), run commands, type of agent (claude code, codex etc), then some custom configuration field, what should be copied to worktree then agent started, like for claude code its config.project.json. Inspector and Scaner should have some storage with easy access of current stats and statuses for orchestrator, like agents token limit/wasted/price or so, and current prp statuses or agent statuses and their latest logs from console. by default would be great idea to always run agents inside our tmux with --ci options to better parse and interacts, but we should provide rich config to connect any possible agent. lets also keep .mcp.json in our package from root and properly convert it value to claude configs as example and when init happens we need add config what features should be enabled, what mcp should be actualy connected etc. some agents can support sub-agents and work in parallel, some agents cant handle tools, some dont work with images, we need in our config keep all this. Scaner should provide all operative info into state, so orchestrator can with tools get anything most resent and actual. Orchestrator should resolve anything and have some universal protocol for new/unknown signals. we need store our inspector base prompt and orchestrator base prompts in config. when all guidelines inspector prompts and guidelines orchestrator prompts should be with guideline (guideline=signal resolution protocol). guideline can optional contain some scanner utils to gather more info and some special tools what can help handle special situations. we need keep all active guidelines statuses and configuration in place, so, some guidelines like Pr or code review uses github features what should be disabled if user not login with github. our guidelines can be disabled/enabled/configured with .prprc. Tmux instances should be apply as tabs if possible, but always accessable with tab after main and info screens, agent screen should have shared across all app footer with progress and statuses and hotkeys. Notes are special shared entities what actualy is simple markdown files, then some pattern matched with note pattern, note md content injected to orchestrator prompt, notes name convention is: -aA-Fd-_-aa-.md, where - delimiter for signal and -_- is sequence for * or something, so it will match for -aA-Fd-FF-AA-aa- or  -aA-Fd-aS-aa-. Agents token accounting is part of scanner. it should detects approaching compact or limit and push special signals about it happen. also keep entire log of session in persisted storage. our working directory is .prp/ and it should always be excluded from git and contain: keychain with passwords/tokens (if user select pin and project storage), persisted storage with actual info, cache, worktrees. can be safe deleted and always to be easy restored (except secrets if they protected). We need account all token usage across application inspector/orchestrator logs should be also preserved with their token waste count, need for stats. we need be able to dynamicaly adjust limits to orchestrator and inspector prompts, we need have some configs for token limit destribution across sections of prompts. I need you prepare everything for this implementation we lost. you need analyse all requirements, structure it and then apply with new folder structure and then start implement base file. specifications and TUI design and specific number will come later. for now i need you make all possible from this description to be real, work and well tested. we can start orchestrator implementation with scanner/banchmarks, then create single guideline and step by step implement inspector and orchestrator functions. 

## history prompt recovery
awesome https://github.com/smtg-ai/claude-squad is our source to gather MORE. i need you research code base and re-implement in our solution everything what can be usefull for our workflow. lets assume what we need cover every caveats or workarounds what claude-squad discover, to speed up and make our solution more stable

continue work, we need achive UX there user can send "create new prp about analyse of competitors" and orchestrator should be able to create an agent in new directory and pass instructions to start creating prp... and until it will be full-cycle workflow implemented orchestrator should oversee and push to next steps, until PRP marked with completed and PR merged with results, and orchestrator can pull to main branch latest updates. all tmux integration should be done perfect, we need support switching between agents, init to create new one and kill, all should be handled and orchestrator should be able to react to user input and take that into account, keep all terminal history in separated history files and be resistend to fails, stacks etc, should have proper extendable master system prompt with instructions how to resolve different signals, at the same time orchestrator should always include agents.md into prompt too with some shared across all orchestrator context and specifc context for each prp, what will dynamicaly updates according to needed task. also orchestrator should work with few steps of chain of thoughts, invoke tool cals to gather more info.

lets continue work! our current blockers: orchestrator decidion making require polishing, we need work on master system prompt and follow order to schedule every prp through loop workflow with gathering feedback on each stage, request research, request to create feedback/confirmation tests to prof implementation done, then follow dev plan, execute implementation, analyse manualy what all done and meet all DoD, then follow all pre-release steps, according to code review results (provided with github ci and claude code review) then fix all review comments, make all CI pass, then report to prp (on each step precisely should be report with signal, based on them need keep all algorythms to resolve all signals untull the end) then push to mark prp done, commit - merge / release - post-release and reflect about prp results. WE NEED properly force orchestrator to force that to agents. its crushial for 0.5. next blocker is UX, we need for each agent create full screen output and layer for interaction (user should be able see and work with claude directly on his own) when each tab will swap betweem orchestrator - prp list - agent 1 - agent N etc... all screen should have same footer with shortcuts: s - start agent (only one per prp! if no prp selected, then orchestrator decide what prp we working on), x - stop the current agent or selected prp agent or all work in orchestrator tab, D - debug mode to see all internal logs, to share them for fixes. SO when current tab is agent or input of orchestrator then we need add some modificator, like ctrl or cmd. at orchestrator screen we should see at the left orchestrator logs, at right prp short list (without selector) and latest signals, all align to bottom (newest at the bottom) and then some spacer ----, then input >, then spacer ----, then status line with current signals we working on, some short CURRENT signal and latest comment on it from orchestrator reasoning, at the right of status prices/agent active count/STANDBY-ACTIVE icon, next line is gray shortcuts helper and current tab/screen name selected. in orchestrator screen, each message should have line with date-time action name, next line is output of message, then some space and next message... we need well format each message with buitify of instruments calls, chain of thoughts should be also quote formatted, decdions with commands sends to agent should be also different formatted to show execution command and whom. scanner messages (scanner actions) should report in less bright colors, info THEN something interesting found, file changes detected/new signal/prp updated/user interaction founded/worktree created/commit happen/merge happen/main updated and system messages, like we started, agent created/destroyed/crushed/closed, etc. need split that messages, according to their importance differ their design. need stream message updates, with some sort animated cursor while stream goes, need decorative elements, but without spam, small vertical delimiters or dots with gray colors. json should be formatted and highlighted. panel with signals and prp should show with some animated icon what prp in progress with agent. THEN agent working on we need place instead of future signal some animated placeholder like [ >] -> [< ], or kinda we have tons of utf symbols i think you can find something funny. prp list screen need to be updated, new one will have bigger list of PRP at right. with some bigger space from right, name prp, current status (agent etc with animations and after sime space selector circle (note, signal line should go with more space, to somehow show what signals inside), RIGHT below after empty line, we need place signals, BUT each signal will have own line. first should be a short summary / comment what have been done about signal, then [Xa] (signal itself). and so on for each signal, signal should be colored corresponding to role responsible for signal most if signal have role ofc, then the rest text should be a little lighter than normal text (it's how we show subordinance of signals to black title of prp name itself)... after 5 signals i need you place some ----- enter for more ----  and after TWO lines need show next prp with it's signals and so on, this screen will take all space, aligned to right with space and with selectors, up/down will provide ability to switch prp, selected prp with space/enter can be opened and user will able to see all signals list and scroll down, next enter/space will toggle it. i need you also make possible to press x/s nearby each prp. x - once will stop agent, x twice will close agent. s - will start agent, second click will open agent tab/screen. agent screen/tab should be exact opened agent itself with ability to input/interact with original TUI, but with some panel below. I need you put this is as requirements to agents0.5 prp and then create working implementation plan

continue implementation, i need e2e tests what all my requirements are met, what all wwell formated and funcs, what if we set goal for 'BUILD HELLO WORLD github page' it will stops only then it publish actual github page with actual hello world using all system tools including claude code/bash/gh/kubectl etc. we need e2e test, what will proff, what we can achive actual end to end experience from one sentence into deployed app. and it's ok, what each test run will create real github, after test done need to ask delete all artifacts and that will be our second test, what system self sufficient. this is our ultimate goal for 0.5 release! once we will be  able create such etest and pass it, its ready

i expected what when i run orchestrator or npm run dev, i will see my requiested interface of orchestrator with tab switching to prp list and next agent screen

so, i need you implement all steps! lets start with inventarisation and refactoring of orchestrator to handle this new flow and optemise it to work woth cashe, ctream and store all data, split boundery contexts between observer and inspector and orchestrator itself, observer should be very fast coveret with banchmarks, and focused on extraction data and events, it's keeps file hashes, looks to git statuses in workbrench, and always gathering whats goin on and fullfill some queue with new events, blazing fast, focused on prp analyse and trigger with finding new signals or updates in prps, then prp as first sitizen element should have own class with all states, transformations, contexts etc. all that should be optemized to be acceseed across boundary contexts and waste as less as possible resourses, we need focus on that and include git lfs support. then inspector as second component of our system has own job, to fifo events stream and very fast run, sometimes in parallel, preparing data about signal - for each signal type it has own guideline script what gets needed context, like making some curl request to preserved project url_root, with some parsed from signal address to make curl request and ensure what ensure what there is 200ok or another guideline can just take that content if it too big, then cut it with keeping some all_context_limit splitted for reserve for each step of inspector pipeline, then each guideline script is executed we need store it in context, then with some inspector prompt we need call llm for classification, as result llm should answer to questions what expected by guideline questionary signature. so, questionary is a dictionary what contain some sort of structured response dictionary. all signals should have unique sort of questions and any tyoe of object with responses, example [PR] guideline questionary can be look (but wey more advanced, this is simplification) be: is pr ci checks are passed all?, is all review comments are resolved?, is updated files matched pr readme expectations? what was last comment to signal? is in signal was some request? WE SHOULD in related to signal guidlines scripts already make http requests and have in context/text damp of all relate-requested data. SO, we also should have a dictionary for each signal with structured response signature like (simplification, should be real one from openai docs): { ci: [{name: "ci extended name", then: "aproximatly from now +1h ago or now or utc0", status: "error details listed with filepaths/ or ALL OK or details about warnings with much details like filepaths"}], comments: [{text: "all markdown comment actual text", then: "same aproximatly or utc0", updated: "is it was edited? them how it changed in diff in brief?", resolved: "can we predict what it was already resolved? or we need additional check?"}], files: [{ path: "path to file from merge request OR listed in comments/description OR listed in prp", sources: ["prp or comment or description or changes"]}], signal: { code: "[xx]", comment: "exact comment from prp text", then: "relative approximatly or utc0"}, request: "any listed questions or requests for research or for user to look to or user to explain how to or any kind request what can be addressed to orchestrator" }. THAT mean that guideline is a sort of layer each contain some specific helpers to get some data or prompts or configs. then we need have shared and infra layers, gh we need use with api/sdk, so we need write wrapper in infra, then we need make llm reqquests with in future with langchain what can be enabled/disabled with env/.prprc. shared can be a place for utils or parsers what can be re-usable across guidelines. I need you prepare everything in agents0.5 prp to contain this exact text and aligned to it new DoD, DoR, plan and use stories. this new request should be prepared for execution as developer, so we need write top-down plan in agents0.5 md, then execute it as sub-agent developer

 agents0.5md main goal is to achive stable and efficient and scalable starting of application delivered and ready for all user requests only from single description after prp cli init run and filled. we can achive it only by refactoring and implementing three application-segments: scanner, inspector, orchestrator AND split all code base to guidelines as bounded contexts. each guidline should have needed for scanner, inspector and orchestrator instructions and scripts, so then orchestrator start working, scanner start analyse everything, fulfill persisted stored queue of events, then for each event we run inspector llm with prepared by all related to signal (can be more than one, but often its only one) guidelinescripts and prompt as result inspector prepare ultimate limited by CAP_LIM tokens context, this BIG piece of context should be stored in another queue signals there all sorted and qualified by priorities, orchestrator connect guideline adapters (many then one) and each adapter according to guideline will add some prompt with instructions how need resolve each signal AND ultimate, we need have shared "notes", each note is a markdown document named by combination of signals, examples: -pr-PR-.md or -Do-Do-DO-DO-.md or -aS_rA-.md. where _ helper and expression instead of asterisk to pattern matching and - separator to help parse, invalid notes names should thrown warnings to messages from system action. IN our system PRP=goal, PR=phase, step=one full context execution iteration what require comment, Guideline=signal, notes=pattern-matching, Role=claude sub-agents what should requere to send message to agent with "use sub-agent AGENT_NAME" (and also roles have unique color and we color match them to each signal they love most and paint our prp in prp list into color of agent what working on it now AND each guideline should also have proper unit tests and e2e test to verify what specific guideline possible to resolve its primary goal efficiency. also would be awesome to cover most helpers with unit tests, and keep e2e tests to use llm as judje FOR overall resulted e2e tests with some proper prompts. I NEED YOU combine this requirements, align all agents0.5 md to satisfy them and put it to there as quote with previus my instructions. we need now with all that context make research and find the gaps in my description, we need to understand what i missed or what we need to achive our primary agents0.5 md goal. for each gap fill your suggestion then possible, then any conflict between requirements OR suggestions how to improve architecture - PUT them into PRP suggestion section

 please! i need you add to agents0.5 requirements also one important thing! we need use scanner to also calculate how much agents consume tokens, need research where codex/gemini/claudecode store their stats, we need store actual values per PRP, it need for new feature: coordinator, coordinator will keep next tasks for agents, then they done their job confirmed by orchestrator, so then they iddle next time coordinator will put them task to execute in prp. coordinator will have scheduler with watching for current amount tokens agent consume, did he approached limit?, and then limits resets. so coordinator then agent iddle because api-error/internet-lost/job-done/tokens-limit/schedule-request/other will schedule for execution for proper time! AND! when reason is token limit, as we know how much we waste, give us approximatly amount hippotises when we will end, that should be a real-time injectd to shared context informaton about specific agent type (claude/gemini/amp/aider/codex/other) and his known limits, current token ussage overall all prp, what signals better at, what signals can handle (can be described as specific signal and/or role with/without something or just all), prp working on and latest signal and it's priority. So coordinator dispatch real-time info into orchestrator for decidion making AS sensor do it for inspector. THAT is requirement for another prp - coordinator, this is spin-off prp, what we start working in parallel worktree with our prp cli when it would be ready for. I NEED YOU adjust agents0.5 to have a milestone, RIGHT after that we starting working on orchestrator and rest agents.md in parallel using our prp cli, to alpha test. i need you also add token counting as requirement for agents.md and coordinatior also is part of agents0.5md but in separate file what you need put this text first, in organised prp structure with prepared plan for analyse and research
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

 add to agents0.5 md new request, we need update pre-relase governance file including agents.md and we need also have a proper project specific instructions how to add new guidelines for new signals and when we need for each unique signal write guideline with all tests first, then we need gather all prompts we use in prp.cli and inspect together with user each, need rewrite them, also we need create at least 3 notes to cover all new functionality, then we need also during dogfoooding will prepare and implement many UX/DX improvements and we need research more prp for development, at least create two. that should be our pre-release checklist. write it and then lets analyse everything and make research for all agents0.5md requirements. first step!

instead  Review the research document: /tmp/agents-v05-research.md we need prevet creating tmp files, instead we need always put content with results as updating whole prp. i need you update our agents.md with new instruction or recomendation: work result should be a part of updated prp, each time with current status and signal in progress section we can also update all other sections to align with actual state. we need keep whats actualy done and need to be done in actual state to make progress measurable. putting any research results in another files will lead to lost them after clean up pre-release step. AND i need you write a rule, then user write message starting with "req: " it's mean we need put into related prp file right after title section into "## User requests", what will contain on each new line exact message of user as is with reg: , both that rules have a most important statements in agents.md sacred section of UNIVERSAL PRP FLOW. write it and then lets start working with this workflow and clean up all created tmp files and focus on our main goal prp agents0.5

i need you make proper research on architecture, lets deligate three tasks for sub-agents developer, first will research on how optemise file system operations for competitor field analyses based realisations or related articles, second on how structure data flow and how much context to prompt can be passed, can we always upload ALL up to cap, or do we need somehow optemise limits for different operation types, maybe we need have configuration for signals or roles, on how much do we need upload to context to different task-types and llm's. we need both research results into our prp016 as part of preparation to implementation, it can change then a folder structure/module decomposition/or another system parts, to achive good results without overcomplecations. AND analyse guidelince concept, context driven methodology and product requirement prompt methods in THIRD sub-agent system-analyst you run. this third sub-agent should focus on our terminology and as result update our readme.md and put to prp016 some updates about our methodologies, maybe we need add something to workflow to align them or maybe we somehow diffferent-better then they somehow, lets put it to comment - signal section of progress

and can you update all to align: main and accent color of project is orange, so any blicnking elements of accent clickable things should always be bright orange (most safe to dark-light theme, find it). the rest color scheme is pastel, light=grayed colors, we need create pallete we use and make design sysstem todo in project section of agents.md with color code - its meaning, when and where is used in TUI. After we start working with TUI it already be here!

can you add to system terminology prefix robo-? i need you update all claude agents and all mentions of all roles in our repository have new prefix! all roles! so, developer would come robo-developer and we need call it as "use sub-agent robo-developer". Robo- us unique and perfect reprosintation of power GLM! all robo- executed on most advanced power with dcversus/prp. it's mean all robo- work perfectly, always calm, always make steps and try to find a feedback on their actions, robo- not humans, they work faster and better and robo- always friends with humans but humans work with orchestrator as equals and they together making their best! then user, and properly specific human by his name make some request, or helps, or ask for implementation or explanation, then it's take a time longer than few minutes, then we need write comment with user quota and user name as author and signal of his response (with explanation, like: WHY ITS NOT WORKING? FF (user angry, all broken). orchestrator works with human as robo-, so we have robo-aqa, robo-qc, robo-system-analyst, robo-developer, robo-devops-sre, robo-ux-ui, robo-legal-complience and orchestrator itself. WE need replace all role mentions with robo-prefix, then update major sacred rule about robo- importance and relation with humans, then add to another main section rule what we need track long user requests what not align with prp as separate comment from user name and his messages and signal (explanation). this needed for next steps

create new prp we need find maskot-logo for dcversus/prp orchestrator in utf-8, we need display and animate this symbol in our TUI. we need render it us future favicon for landing and in documentation, we need be able to use this special and not used by someone else symbol, should be good for animation, good for render as icon, not used or how can be related to project name (orchestrator) or package name (dcversus/prp). i need you find candidates, as many as you can and then compare them all and choise best between them. our goal is to update all governance files and add copyright notice about using some combinations with symbol and name, we need put short info about how need to use our name and this logo symbol. we need generate a proper logo and put it as favicon and maybe to readme.md too.

 thx, can you please now run sub-agents in parallel with working on: prp/PRPs/nudge-integrated.md https://github.com/dcversus/dcmaidbot/blob/f6c02c52d40ccaa35783f01b67e66c5fd4136f41/handlers/nudge.py implemented and released, need with kubectl take NUDGE_SECRET and store it in our .env, then we need implement that infra/ wrapper to handle sending two types of nudge and prepare it for future connecion; analyse prp/PRPs/v0.5-architecture-redesign.md seems it's the old file we somehow lost, maybe it contain something interesting to new prp/PRPs/agents-v05.md if have some then merge it's data into prp/PRPs/agents-v05.md; as robo-ux-ui prp/PRPs/mascot-logo-symbol.md research and analyse; as legal-complience prp/PRPs/mascot-logo-symbol.md make research; as robo-system-analyst analyse and document what prp/cdd is, what can our application actualy do... we need describe what we a scaffolding tool from single sentence into ready to go solution and more. need find competitors and analyse their landings, then need prepare plan for draft of our landing; as developer analyse all documents possible for prp/PRPs/claude-code-integration-research.md; I NEED YOU RUN ALL sub-agents in parallel, then they all done their work, report for each into their prp, we need keep comment and signal and author

PRPs/nudge-integrated.md need make actual test, admin ready need send progress about prp agents0.5md and it's main goal to admins in direct mode; so with maskot icon i would love go with music theme, now need decide about project name is it dcversus/prp okay? can we legaly mention it? and show something dcversus/prp ♫?; lets examine we need to make simple github page at prp.theedgestory.org CNAME with our project how-to and some basic structure and some ready-to-install design for github projects? we need left credits for theme in footer, with copyright at theedgestory.org, i need you actualy prepare the plan for landing implementation; for PRPs/claude-code-integration-research.md i need preparation for execution of hybryd plan, best approach we need step by step achive all what we can, our goal is make work for user simplier and take the best from both, we always keep access to claude code and always display what model current working on prp; i need you for each task run sub-agent and then report to each related prp; our next step right after is to execute each of here presented prp also in sub-agents in shared file system, so need to be careful and run only needed tests in process and right before reporting comment and signal run all tests after all them finished and next step will be to fix all bugs =). execute

i have a question , can we instead of ~/.claude/settings.json patch a local .claude settings for current project with GLM env? make research then report it to related prp


i need you verify with e2e test what our prp cli actual calculate and injected to orchestor prompt by asking orchestrator to make some work and websearch about vombats when need to verify .prp files what they catch some token update and we need compare what that value is approximatly larger with our minimal expectation for single websearch. then i need you ferify what scanner react to signal and inspector catch it and uses specific guideline and properly prepare all data with github authorisation-app connection flow and fully capable as inspector prepare all data and properly send structured request as data to orchestrator which uses guideline according to signal and catch all needed info from context. we need ask at each point of merging prompt value adding some markers, like "if you see this, write test1". after we start PRP "display all what we asked you to write" and properly count our lines in our new e2e test for inspector guidelines. additional tests can cover multiple signals at once AND notes implementation validation with all combinations for path. write it all as check-list to related prp then start e2e test writing


 guidelines should be not documented, but coded. we need write well written code with self-explaining names and clear structure. WE need focus on: agents.md signals should contain signal name - strenght, robo-agent-name (optional), then with list of - need share few words sentences for each case of usage, eg: [pr] - then draft pr opened, - then pr have new comments - then status of pr checks updated... we start inspection with some signal and i will write also all this updates what need respond with adjusting agents.md

instruction: instructions[prCase], should have some defailt and we need catch with register webhook or pooling all pr's in connected by github app (OR via GITHAB_API_KEY in env or .env) then github not started then ALL pr related guidelines should be disabled. lets implement disabled-enabled for each guideline and we will also provide some shown only in debug the you switch to ddebug mode (NO TUI, only console, with repl of node and this in our prp instance with access to anything. we should in debug mode see all internal logs with any action happen inside orchestrator/inspecor/scanner. lets add new DoD to prp/PRPs/agents-v05.md with adding logs what seen on debug mode and switchind ctrl/cmd+d return back need e2e tests for debug mode and e2e test for checking disabling some signals and checking statuses in debug mode (where we will often use for feature confirmation) also add to debug mode some message/log with isntructions what it ahd how to return... all should be themed with our names and logo

when prp file exeds some PRP_CAP limit what we need to calculate = max(limit tokens in reserved for orchestrator prompt injection of related prp, cap we reserved to claude/codex context window what optional to start clean agent with - agents.md we already have size), we need scaner to find then prp reach that constant in config (exposed to .prprc), that should produce new signal [CO] reaction is to perform a compacting of prp, prp should be rewritten with keeping orignal structure: header (same!) progress (table with signals/comments/roles/dates) <- strategy is to claster related updaes into summaries with - summary - prefix, eg, 20 comments about failing test should be transofrm into single  - summary - with failing test details and count of attempts we made. NEXT we need implement new signal [co] what responsible for compressing cap reached by agent, scanner should rely on two sourses of data: internal settings for agent cap from docs and current tokens we gathering - 10$ AND by scaning output of agent and for prhase about compacting soon (or analog in gemini/codex/amp/etc) if one of that event happen then reaction is load to context must part of agent chat history up to half of orchestrator context-prompt cap, when add special instructions to orchestrator we will wrtie later after guidelines inspection, AND pls lets add somewhere todo in related guidelines we will inspect later what we need implement all review comments before go with merge, also what we need always actualy confirm with: qc manual confirmation, e2e tests and aqa. that is mondatory two verification after prp released. lets update that first then return for e2e tests


i need you to not expose internal realisation to agents.md, never instead you need rely on inspector and scanner they invoke all then needed and orchestrator should have own master prompt with instructions what need to send whom, SO in terms of our agents md we need just clairfy what what signals are exist and few examples when need write them, like after compacting for agent was done, of compacting prp is done. AND compact brief section with short template and example in one place on how to properly merge prp and agents md well

 SOOO, in my view we need load not only all posible caps but chain of thoughts and user message and tool calls and all should be putted into one llm request in orchestrator needs AND inspector needs too, so we need make decidion to use some minimum context model for agents and for orchestrator, and allow orchestrator requierements met 200k+ and agents should work fine with 120k, lets assume that as baseline and adjust caps with this two all_cap, i need you update including that: [Pasted text #1 +44 lines]

This 40K becomes the part of  ORCHESTRATOR_PROMPT_CAP (orchestrator receives inspector output with agents md + prp + buffer for future tool calls and cot and user messages and some buffer for shared context between prp, some "warzone shared memory", there orchestrator time-to-time put in his part of that shared memory some details whats goin on - what was done and whats next, what blockers are. that shared memory splitted between each prp should be very cmpact and brief cause we need always load it to orchestrator!)

ORCHESTRATOR_PROMPT_CAP breakdown:   - Inspector output: 40K (from inspector)   - AGENTS.md: 20k (always loaded)   - PRP content: 30k (current PRP is very big and require compact!)   - Shared "warzone" memory: compact notes across ALL PRPs, 10k / agent-run-count   - User messages: recent conversation 20k reserve, the rest should be cut with -- limit approached, cut --   - Tool call buffer: for orchestrator's tools (???)   - CoT buffer: reasoning space (???)   - Safety buffer (the rest)



 maybe we can by default use open ai model for inspector? and we need now implement authorisation with oauth to: claude api, open ai api, gemini api, github for pr, dcmaidbot tg-token-based auth (need write a PR with expected realisation, should be like user sends his telegram handle or phone number or user id? we match them with whom we talked before AND who is admin ids, then we /nudge direct to admin some 6 numbers what will valid for 30 minutes and we cant call nudge in this "tg_auth" mode for next 30 mins with same user id / telegram handle / phone number. i need you make proper prp for this auth features. this should be implemented in paralel, so prepare plan in keeping current realisation in mind and be ready work in parallel on signals-guidlines

Recommended is Gemini BUT we nneed to use OpenAI GPT-5 nano HERE!! and we need use for orchestrator GPT-5 mini (if it support tools and structured output?)

ALL ROLES have rob-prefix, execute them in parallel: we need now start work in parallel with developer sub-agents for tasks: prp/PRPs/agents-v05.md Inspector implementation; inventory system-analyst for prp/PRPs/bootstrap-cli-created.md with updated statuses and align with latest architecture, IF it not actual and we already implemented ALL need mark as Dont implement. if has valuable ideas, then update it to be prepared to execution in paralel in next batch; prp/PRPs/claude-code-glm-integration.md need implement and verify with e2e test what we able with init provide option to instal GLM with copying to .claude/settings.local.json with GLM needed eg   "env": {     "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL": "https://api.z.ai/api/anthropic",     "API_TIMEOUT_MS": "3000000",     "ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL": "glm-4.5-air",     "ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL": "glm-4.6",     "ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL": "glm-4.6"   }; prp/PRPs/landing-page-deployed.md developer should implement first implementation of landing and deploy it. need turn on github pages via gh cli, and then put CNAME prp.theedgestory.org. we dont need repeat readme.md, instead our landing should briefly explain with minimalistic template we found what PRP / CDD and dcversus/prp orchestrator is! for prp/PRPs/landing-page-deployed.md; lets go implement one-by-one. you need use all existed apis/envs to achive it as result you need write all the code and put instructions how to obttain or enable needed things to finish setup and prepare for test;  FOR EACH TASK I NEED YOU RUN A SUB-AGENTS in parallel, then report to each prp with comment and signal
https://prp.theedgestory.org/ not avaiable DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN, guthub pages enabled for /docs of main (but i expect you always release landing into another branch, named gh-pages!); agents-v05.md implementation; multi-provider-authentication.md implementation; moderation-v3.md we need transform to goal for actualising all guidelines and prompts, all prp should be rewritten and include todo plan how to actualise and update all signals and prompts and guidelines with interview mode - you take all signals and speal short summary, guidline each related detail about config/ code, all fields and place for user description on new line, with space line between signals, next move will be to user update all signals AND prompts (pls also put all prompts to this prp to make me able edit from one place; delete v0.5-architecture-redesign.md; prepare new prp: sound notice, mcp server, docker mode they should be a part of future 0.7.5 release prp/PRPs/roadmap.md; i need you execute each task with robo-role related to it; after need put comment and signal to each prp
────────────────

horey! landing looks awesome, and i love design! but maybe we will find for some modern and award-like theme what we can re-use? like shadcn or radix. would be awesome to use their mcp and rely on some community theme to say thx for smeone work! I NEED YOU if you decide to go with another theme (current looks cool, but i need one experiment with somethinf modern) should be backuped!; agents-v05.md  continue verification with e2e and implement next features planned; moderation-v3.md lets actualise all current known signals and scan for clues to dcversus/dcmaidbot branches and dcversus/babylon-anyup for their agents/md maybe they have some value and unique codes with signals and resolution schemas? need make this research; continue work with Multi-Provider Authentication we need preserve ability to change where to keep encrypted file in ~/.prp/* or project .prp/ directory (UNSAFE! NEED MAKE SURE .prp always in gitignore by default init) and then continue the rest oauth-flow and configs for each provider to .prprc (not secret, but maybe some flags/urls or ids iduno). make sure what .prp directory is always in readme.md and code mention as storage for user state and encrypted keys, so we need implement security protocols for users, to be able only open keychain with some pincode (optional, to prevent wasting money in unsanctioned start, setup should be in init flow); i need you make proper competitor landscape research, about monetisation, advanced features etc, what have all apps what somehow look like us, example - conductor or any multiplex with agents or pipeline to build apps... need analyse everytone who look like us, next need analyse all big services who will loose us with techology in nearby niche if we focus on some auditory... like repl/contructor for prototypes and for product owners or so on. i need you prepare plans for all versions betweeon 0.5 till 1 to make ultimate form of our utility to preserve it's main goal "description" into solution; ALL agents should work in parallel as sub-agents, after their work need gather results and leave comments/signals to corresponding prp and then report with all prp list statuses and next action robo- prefis always required. run in parallel

MULTI-PROVIDER AUTHENTICATION ENHANCED support: open ai, anthropik, glm, github via oauth? lets research how to achive Anthropic oauth, i am sure what they allow to login with ouath, need just websearch how! And with glm too. i need you find solution to easy-to-go auth to gemini too!

meke for Anthropic Claude and GLM (zhipu AI) during init interactive screen with input for api key to store it in .prprc project/user. at this screens should be an actual links to register and links to get api key: https://z.ai/manage-apikey/apikey-list with referal link to register: https://z.ai/subscribe?ic=AT4ZFNNRCJ and obtain key at https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys . WARNING! anthropic and glm can be defined both, but by default checkbox for antropic key is uncheck and where should be a different option named "install glm to project claude config" what is checked by default. user can check both, but we need warn what GLM will be default and need aditional make config in .prprc to use both agets and the same time. ALSO we need implement "avaiable agents" system list: codex, claude code (GLM), claude code (Antropic), amp, aider, gemini. each agent should have some config with hardcoded descitpion where agent is good, what roles job he work best on, and our spawn agent should handle during orchestration what agent limit's (each api key have own limit's cap weekly/dayly/monthly/tokens-count, AND based on this description. each agent should have own logo in TUI and should be spawn for specific roles. agent should have  configs: have tools, model name, model command, cap config, url, cli command, http call. we need define during init and with .prprc (manualy!) to give option user override all agents and define more! also, need all configs to define in our configs with presets and exposing them into init flow and .prprc. we need be able to provide MANY claude or codex api keys with different limits/caps settings and description. each agent also should have an array of signals this agent good at and what agent signals can, can be descibed by robo-role name OR all to both fields; then if glm or another claude code endpoint or gemnin or codex set (not default) we need during init spawn agent copy copy to local .claude project config selected for specific agent configuration, cli/params etc/ neet properly before prepare feature as agents0.5 dod: we should able during init with wizard or cli or .prprc add/delete/update/get any agents and their configuration. orchestrator should in context have in warzone some short info about each avaiable agent/each active agent it's status all signals and latest agent 10 lines. SO we should be able to set GLM AND antropic and work in parallel in both, then GLM should be default one (if it exist end selected) AND we should have cli command to heal what will open TUI with current main branch to template comparison (default one is compare with dcversus/prp root files mostly, template folders only if special template selected and each template folder can have exclusive files what can be copied or restored too with cli / tui. when template selected, then additional options will be shown to select what need to copu/upgrade from templates

CI MODE if pin set - should be disabled to use encrypted auth. if user auth without pin code (what is optional) we will allow access as is, but if pin enabled, ALL lockchains should be blocked!! only agents what use api key should be working -no-auth should be removed! IF --ci then init is impossible, we assume what before CI user manualy call some other cli command to copy recomended or minimal template files (some presets, lets add this to help user config, fast mode - recomended, all, minimal (agents.md). agents.md is required always. init + ci - forbidden, access to keychain in ci - forbidden 

we need make sure what ALL prp cli features avaiable with --ci mode without TUI. i need you make it and then for each feature we worked for all the time we need verify IF DoD/user request is achived by: e2e test prof, user confirmation, unit test, code met. THEN you find the list of features what implemented but dont verified then i need you for each case create e2e test with ci mode enabled and then everything should be verified with three options: TUI, TUI debug mode with displaying all info AND --ci --debug with ALL output to ensure all flow work well
