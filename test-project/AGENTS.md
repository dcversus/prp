## 🛠️ Development Workflow
This project follows the PRP (Product Requirement Prompts) methodology with signal-driven development:
### Key Workflows
1. **PRP Analysis**: Requirements are captured in Product Requirement Prompts
2. **Signal System**: Progress is tracked through structured signals in PRPs
3. **Agent Coordination**: Specialized agents handle different aspects of development
4. **Continuous Integration**: Automated quality checks and deployment
### Getting Started
1. `npx prp` - Start the orchestrator for agent coordination
2. Create PRPs in the `PRPs/` directory for new features
3. The system will auto-detect and process requirements
---
## 📊 Project Status
- **Current Status**: Project initialized
- **Next Milestone**: Set up development environment and initial PRP creation
- **Team Capacity**: Ready for parallel development with multiple agents
---
## 🔧 Configuration
The project configuration is managed through:
- **.prprc**: Main project configuration file
- **PRP Directory**: Contains all Product Requirement Prompts
- **Agent Guidelines**: This AGENTS.md file defines agent workflows
---
## 📋 Quick Reference
### Common Commands
- `npx prp orchestrator` - Start agent coordination
- `npx prp init` - Initialize new project or upgrade existing
- `npx prp wizard` - Interactive project setup
### Signal Examples
- `[aa]` - Admin attention needed for project decisions
- `[gg]` - Goal clarification and requirements analysis
- `[dp]` - Development progress updates
- `[da]` - Done assessment and quality gates
---
## 🚀 First Steps
1. **Review Configuration**: Check `.prprc` for project settings
2. **Create Initial PRP**: Start with a simple setup PRP in `PRPs/`
3. **Run Orchestrator**: Begin agent coordination with `npx prp`
