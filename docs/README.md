```

## 📖 What is PRP?

PRP (Product Requirement Prompts) is a revolutionary methodology that combines:

- **Living Requirements** - PRPs evolve with implementation in real-time
- **Signal-Driven Communication** - 44-signal taxonomy eliminates meeting overhead
- **Autonomous Coordination** - AI agents manage dependencies and workflow
- **Zero-Touch Delivery** - From concept to production without human intervention

## 🎵 The Musical Metaphor

We use musical terminology because development, like music, is **temporal**:

- **♪ Scanner (Tuner)** - Watches for changes, sets the rhythm
- **♩ Inspector (Critic)** - Analyzes signals, provides harmony
- **♫ Orchestrator (Conductor)** - Coordinates the performance
- **♬ Agents (Players)** - Execute their parts to perfection

> _"Tools disappear. Flow remains."_
