## Overview

In the PRP methodology, humans act as agents within the autonomous system. This doesn't mean replacing humans, but rather defining clear roles and intervention points where human judgment is most valuable.

## The Human Role

### When to Intervene
1. **Initial Requirements** - Provide the user quote that drives PRP creation
2. **Complex Decisions** - Handle ambiguous situations AI cannot resolve
3. **Quality Validation** - Perform final verification of critical features
4. **Strategic Direction** - Set overall project goals and constraints
5. **Exception Handling** - Address incidents and edge cases

### Intervention Patterns

#### [aa] Admin Attention
- Use when reports or oversight are needed
- Specify exact requirements for administrative review
- Wait for guidance before proceeding

#### [af] Feedback Request
- Request decisions on design approaches
- Provide context and options
- Wait for direction before implementation

#### [bb] Blocker Resolution
- Identify blockers beyond AI capabilities
- Document constraints and dependencies
- Escalate appropriately

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Signals**: Always use proper signal notation
2. **Context Preservation**: Maintain context in PRPs
3. **Decision Documentation**: Record decisions in PRP progress
4. **Quality Gates**: Verify before merging to production

## Human-AI Collaboration

### Complementary Strengths
- **AI**: Pattern recognition, consistency, parallel execution
- **Human**: Strategic thinking, empathy, creative problem-solving

### Trust but Verify
- AI implements, humans validate
- Continuous feedback loop
- Learning from each interaction
